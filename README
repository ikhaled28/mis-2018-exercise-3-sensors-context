As we tested our thresholds based on our own activity where we found that for Jogging FFT peak is 350-600 and from location manager 
the speed is around 0.4 - 2.0 meter/second. Unfourtunately due to lack of Cycle and Car we couldn't tested our values for those two parts,
but as from our assumption is we used few peak values which we thought will be best for those to parts.

Thanks.
